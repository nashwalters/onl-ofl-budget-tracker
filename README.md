## Description
This is a bugdet tracker application. The apllication is an existing application, however I added functionality to our existing the application to allow for offline access and functionality. Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

## Technology
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

[Mongoosejs](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html)

[IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API)

## Usage
The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. The user is able to enter the name and the amount of the transaction. If the transaction is an expense the user clicks on the `Subtract Funds` button, however if the transaction is a deposit the `Add Funds` button is clicked. All transactions entered appear in a table. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

### Deployment
The application was deployed with a MongoDB database to Heroku. A [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) account was created and a database was connected from there to the application.
